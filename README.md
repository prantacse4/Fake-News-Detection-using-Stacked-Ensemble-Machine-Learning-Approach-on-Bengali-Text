Read Before using!

`Warning! This is a research project. You must provide credits refer this before using this in your project or any purpose`

## To setup this project, there are two ways:
## 1. The best way is setup in Google Colab
##    -> Download The .ipynb file and upload it to google colab
##    --------Dataset Folder---------
##    -> Download the dataset and stemming rules which is provided at the end of the document
##    -> Upload these files into google drive
##    -> Link these files with the correct directory as you uploaded
##    -> Or Make a folder named as `Datasets` in Your Drive, then create `BanglaFakeNews` inside Dataset and upload `ReadyData` folder and `Bangla_FakeNews_Dataset_Preprocessed_complete_all.csv` here
##    -> Now create another folder named as `Rules_Stemming` in `Datasets` upload `mainsuffixrules.csv`, `execeptionlist.csv`, `manual_list.csv` files here

## 2. Jupyter Notebook
##    -> Dataset folder path `Do same as provided above for google drive in your pc`
##    -> Install required libraries as proved below
##    -> Open the .ipynb file in jupter notebook and run the cells

## Follow any of the step provided above
## Just run the cells

## Install Must Required Libraries
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Dataset Links
## Stemming Rules is provided with this repository
## `ReadyData` Folder Link: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/12oVzZwkQAj4tkvzix8znjQ85lBAexFgK?usp=sharing
## `Bangla_FakeNews_Dataset_Preprocessed_complete_all.csv` File Link: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1pON5jHraUsO4M6tR595w0RYa-I46FRkv/view?usp=share_link

## Preprocessing the data will consume time in any environments. So we also provide the preprocessed data to be used directly in any feature extraction method as `Bangla_FakeNews_Dataset_Preprocessed_complete_all.csv`

All setup is completed!
